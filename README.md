## Getting Started

The site is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It needs no build step.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pairakshith/svt-kalasa.git
   cd svt-kalasa
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

   The gallery loads its data with `fetch`, so some browsers block it when a page is opened straight from the file system. If the gallery shows "ಚಿತ್ರಗಳನ್ನು ಲೋಡ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ", run a local server instead:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit <http://localhost:8000>.

**Deployment:** The site is published with GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

---

## Configuration

The photo submission form in `js/gallery.js` uses three settings at the top of the file:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` | Formspree form that receives submission details |
| `IMGBB_API_KEY` | ImgBB key used to host photos uploaded from a device |
| `TEMPLE_EMAIL` | Temple address used by the "send by email" fallback |

Replace the placeholder values with the temple's own accounts before going live.

## Updating Content

### Adding a photo

Add an entry to `data/gallery.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-here",
  "title": "Photo title (Kannada)",
  "category": "festivals",
  "categoryKn": "ಉತ್ಸವಗಳು",
  "imagePath": "../assets/images/your_photo.jpg",
  "caption": "Optional caption",
  "date": "2026-01-15"
}
```

- `id` should be unique. Each `id` is used for one photo.
- `categoryKn` is the category name shown on screen. The lightbox filter buttons are built from these values automatically.
- `imagePath` is relative to `pages/photos.html`.
- `caption` and `date` are optional.

Photos are sorted into portrait and landscape sections automatically, based on their dimensions.

### Festivals and traditions

Festival descriptions are in `traditions.md`. Edit the Markdown file, and the page updates the next time it loads.
